title: First Crossword Puzzle

This is my first crossword puzzle! I'm trying to create
crossword puzzles in the style of NY Times puzzles, and
there are a few requirements:

* 15x15 grid (can be 21x21 for Sunday puzzles but let's
not get ahead of ourselves)
* No words can be less than 3 letters
* Black squares must have rotational symmetry

See if you can solve it :)

This crossword puzzle was made for the AMI Revolution 2024
event! This is an event where people in Acts Ministries
International (AMI) churches from around the world can
come together to worship and draw closer to God.

The crossword puzzle has extra clues related to Bible verses
(all in NIV) as well as Biblical and worship-themed clues
throughout the puzzle. The clue for 35 across is a reference
to the event itself, which takes place on a long weekend.
